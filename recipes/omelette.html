        <h2> What is an Omelette?</h2>
        <p> In cuisine, an omelette or omelet is a dish made from beaten eggs, fried with butter or oil in a frying pan (without stirring as in scrambled egg). It is quite common for the omelette to be folded around fillings such as chives, vegetables, mushrooms,
            meat (often ham or bacon), cheese, or some combination of the above.

        <h3>How to make an omelette in 5 easy steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> <strong> Beat the eggs:</strong>Use two or three eggs per omelette, depending on how hungry you are. Beat the eggs lightly with a fork.</li>
            <li> <strong>Melt the butter:</strong>Use an 8-inch nonstick skillet for a 2-egg omelette, a 9-inch skillet for 3 eggs. Melt the butter over medium-low heat, and keep the temperature low and slow when cooking the eggs so the bottom doesnâ€™t get
                too brown or overcooked.</li>
            <li> <strong>Add the eggs:</strong>Let the eggs sit for a minute, then use a heatproof silicone spatula to gently lift the cooked eggs from the edges of the pan. Tilt the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the edge of the pan.</li>
            <li> <strong>Fill the omelette:</strong>Add the fillingâ€”but donâ€™t overstuff the omeletteâ€”when the eggs begin to set. Cook for a few more seconds.</li>
            <li> <strong>Fold and serve: </strong>Fold the omelette in half. Slide it onto a plate with the help of a silicone spatula. Enjoy ðŸ˜‹ </li>
